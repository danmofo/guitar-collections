Guitar Collections
===

Guitar Collections is a small hobby project built purely for learning purposes.

Getting started on a new machine:

- Make a virtualenv
- `git clone git@github.com:danmofo/guitar-collections.git`
- `pip install -r 'requirements.txt'`
- `bower install`

note: It is currently **not** production ready and requires quite a lot of work to get to that point.
